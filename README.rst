IP-XACT 2014 Manifest Utils
===========================

About
-----

Collection of Python3 scripts to compile IP-XACT 2014 catalog and component files to describe structure
of a resusable IP. This primarily targets Verilog/SystemVerilog IPs.

As of early 2024, the repository is in inception and highly experimental state. The repository has been seeded
from IP-XACT experiments in an earlier `IP-XACT gist <https://gist.github.com/brabect1/4b1f45db2aae8f5f0d635ec22b5060ca>`_.
